# LinearBlendSkinning
This is the Linear Blend Shaping assignment that I completed for my Computer Animation Class in the Fall of 2021 at Texas A&amp;M.

This assignment was created by Dr. Shijiro Sueda, and was meant to teach the basics of Linear Blend Skinning by using CPU Skinning with known bones and weights that correlate to the vertices, which is provided in the form of obj and txt files. This project also incorporates texture switching. This project uses OpenGL and GLM libraries to animate the object, we used this fat elvis obj file that was obtained here: https://www.mixamo.com/

# How to Run
This is meant to be run using OpenGL, and while I will not go into extensive detail about how to download this, here is a tutorial from Dr. Sueda, so that you can run this project if you so desire. https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sueda/courses/CSCE489/2021F/labs/L00/index.html

# Commands while Running
* Ctrl + Click Drag to zoom in/out
* 'z' shows vertex view of the obj
* Space to start dancing
* If you go into the data folder and look at input.txt, you can change which meshes are being used in the animation.

# Recreating the Project
Here is the link to Dr. Sueda's assignment so that you can try this out yourself, all credit is to Dr. Sueda.
